# Lab Exercise: More Cookbooks

## Lab Objectives

* Apply apt, chef-client, and fail2ban recipes via a base role
* Include the apache2 recipe in the webserver recipe
* Download and examine the haproxy cookbook

## Acceptance Criteria

* "base" role is created with the apt, chef-client and fail2ban
  recipes.
* "base" role is applied to the remote target system.
* Answer the questions

## Download cookbooks

Download the following cookbooks to the local repository and extract
them in the `cookbooks` directory.

* apt
* chef-client
* fail2ban
* apache2

With a single knife command, upload all four cookbooks.

## Create base role

In the roles directory, create a `base.rb` for the base role. It
should have a run list containing the `apt`, `fail2ban` and
`chef-client` recipes.

    recipe[apt],
    recipe[fail2ban],
    recipe[chef-client]

## Add apache2 to webserver cookbook

Use `include_recipe` in the `webserver` cookbook's default recipe to
add the `apache2` default recipe.

Update the `webserver` cookbook's `metadata.rb` file to depend on the
`apache2` cookbook.

## Update the roles

Upload both the `base` and `webserver` roles to the Chef Server.

## Add the base role

Add the base role to be the first item in the remote target node's run list.

Run `chef-client` on the remote target node.

## Download haproxy cookbook

Download and extract the haproxy cookbook to the `cookbooks`
directory. Examine its contents but do not upload it to the Chef
Server yet. Do not apply it to the node's run list, that will be done
in the next exercise.

## Questions
