# Chef Log Locations

Chef configures a "logger" object.

The logger sends messages to STDOUT by default

The logger can be configured to send to a specific log in the
client.rb, or on the command-line.

    # in /etc/chef/client.rb
    log_location STDOUT
    log_location "/var/log/chef/client.log"

    # command-line
    chef-client -L /var/log/chef/client.log

# Chef Log Locations

Chef can run as a system service a variety of ways. On Linux/Unix
systems, it is common to use an init script,
e.g. `/etc/init.d/chef-client`. The default location for the log file is:

* `/var/log/chef/client.log`

Other daemonization methods vary, e.g., runit captures STDOUT, to a
file:

* `/etc/sv/chef-client/log/main/current`

# Chef Log Level

"INFO" with "verbose" logging output is the default. `verbose_logging`
shows messages about the resource being processed when Chef runs.

    # in /etc/chef/client.rb
    log_level :info
    log_level :debug
    verbose_logging true
    verbose_logging false

    # command-line
    chef-client -l debug

# Debug Logging

All the various commands in Chef can enable debug log output.

The location for the log can also be specified.

This is handled with the mixlib-log library.

# Debug logging

    # With command-line arguments
    <command> -l debug
    <command> -L /tmp/debug.log

    # In the appropriate config file
    log_level :debug
    log_location "/tmp/debug.log"

These are applicable to all the commands used by Chef.

shef, chef-client, chef-solo and even ohai.

knife uses -VV

# Debug Logging

    chef-client -l debug -L /tmp/chef-client-$$.log
    knife -VV -L /tmp/knife-debug.log

A couple examples of enabling debug logging. With Knife this is actually -VV (changed in 0.10.0).

`$$` is the PID of the running process.

# Chef Stack Traces

Chef completely halts execution when it encounters an unhandled exception.

It doesn't know if the error is something serious that can cause state issues that are unrecoverable.

It is up to you to fix the error and re-run Chef.

Stack traces are left behind in a file, by default
`/var/chef/cache/chef-stacktrace.out`. The directory location is
`file_cache_path` in `/etc/chef/client.rb`.

# Chef Stack Traces

Dumping the entire stack is helpful because it shows all the methods
that were called and which line in the library they are found.

However, knowing where to look is the key.

# Common Errors

We're going to look at some common errors that are easily
resolved. The lines with the full path to the Ruby file can be long so
the non-unique part will be truncated.

* non-existent cookbook
* error in a template
* non-zero return code from a command
* invalid search query syntax

# Non-existent cookbook

    undefined local variable or method `ode' for

    (Chef::Mixin::Template::TemplateError)

Clearly from the first message, this is a template error.

What template is this from?

# Template Error

The last part of the stack trace comes from dumping the exception from
the exception handler.

We need to scroll up in the output to find what template and where.

# Template Error

The output from the run before the exception handler dumped the stack
trace. This shows the offending line ("ode" instead of "node").

    ERROR: template[/tmp/chef-getting-started.txt]
    (/var/cache/chef/cookbooks/getting-started/recipes/default.rb:20:in

The first line of the stack trace will show the command and the return
code.

The expected return code by default is zero.

If Chef is run with a TTY, the command output is displayed.

# Non-Zero Return

    chef-client -l debug

Run Chef with debug logging (more on this later).

This generates a lot of output but the error message will be near the
bottom.

# Non-Zero Return

Output is truncated:

    ...

Search query syntax follows SOLR Lucene

If there's a syntax error, we'll see a 500 from the server.

To find where the query is in the recipe, look for the line above.

# Invalid Search

    % sudo sed -n 25p cookbooks/getting-started/recipes/default.rb

We can view the specific line in the cookbook on the node with sed.

Or just view it in your local repository with your favorite editor.

# Fixing Recipe Errors

Fixing recipes errors is relatively straightforward after they have
been detected similar to the approaches above.

* Modify the recipe / cookbook.
* Upload cookbook to Chef Server.
* Run Chef on node(s).

# HTTP Status Codes

The Chef Server has a RESTful HTTP API.

Since Chef speaks HTTP, some conditions may cause an HTTP status code.

Most of the time this should be a "200 OK". Occassionally some error
condition will cause a different kind of HTTP status code.

# HTTP Status Codes

Common status codes.

* 401 unauthorized
* 403 forbidden
* 404 not found
* 409 conflict
* 412 precondition failed
* 500 internal server error
* 503 service unavailable

# HTTP Status Code

    WARN: HTTP Request Returned 401 Unauthorized: Failed the
    authorization check
    net/http.rb:2101:in `error!': 401 "Unauthorized"
    (Net::HTTPServerException)

# 401 Unauthorized

Common causes:

* System time is not properly synced
* Incorrect node name
* Incorrect client configuration
* Invalid certificate file (validation or client)
* Not in the correct directory structure for knife to find the knife.rb

The Chef Server message will indicate what the likely cause is.

# 403 Forbidden

Common causes:

* ACL on Opscode Hosted Chef
* Timeout retrieving files or other transient error from from Opscode Hosted Chef (on S3)
* Creating a data bag item when the bag doesn't exist
* Attempting to create an API Client that already exists

.notes i.e., you tried to create a new node with the same name as an old
node, perhaps one where the node was deleted but the corresponding
client was not

# 404 Not Found

Common causes

* Source cookbook_file or template was requested but not uploaded
* Another file in the cookbook was not found when requested.
* Initial run of chef-client when the node doesn't yet exist (normal)

# 409 Conflict

This usually happens when a new client is attempting to save itself as
a node that already exists.

Usually this is a warning or info (depending on context), and can be
ignored, but you should be aware of it.

# 412 Precondition Failed

This usually happens when cookbook metadata isn't updated for a
dependency, or a cookbook wasn't uploaded.

A typo on a recipe name in a run list can also cause a 412 error.

# 500 Internal Server Error

This is rarely a user error, however as discussed SOLR search syntax
errors can cause a 500 error.

Otherwise, something on the server backend had an error that wasn't
handled.

* For Opscode Hosted Chef, operations staff is notified on 500s.
* We investigate and resolve these as quickly as possible.

# 503 Service Unavailable

Occasionally, Opscode will perform maintenance on Hosted Chef. For
example we recently did a data center migration.

If you see a 503 and weren't expecting it, check
[status.opscode.com](http://status.opscode.com).

If you need help, open a ticket at
[help.opscode.com](http://help.opscode.com) or email
[support@opscode.com](mailto:support@opscode.com).

# Running a Chef Server

If you encounter any of the HTTP status codes, you can enable debug
logging for the server.

Seek help through the community on the mailing list
([lists.opscode.com](http://lists.opscode.com)) or IRC ([irc.freenode.net #chef](irc://irc.freenode.net/chef)).

# Handling Errors in Recipes

Recipes are "just Ruby".

Normally we can use a begin/rescue block to handle errors.

We can also cause Chef to bail out.

# begin..rescue

    @@@ruby
    begin
      aws = data_bag_item('aws', 'main')
    rescue
      raise
    end

"raise" will raise an exception and cause Chef to exit, we can
also use code to handle the error gracefully.

# Chef::Application.fatal!

    @@@ruby
    Chef::Application.fatal!("I encountered a problem")

The Chef::Application class has a fatal! method that takes a string printed to FATAL level in the logger, and optionally a return status.

# Ignoring Failure

If the failure for a particular resource is acceptable, you can use
the `ignore_failure` meta-parameter to tell Chef not to exit if it
encounters an error configuring that resource.

    @@@ruby
    execute "apt-get update" do
      ignore_failure true
    end

This is available to every resource.

# Exception and Report Handlers

Chef has an API for reporting and exception handling.

Full coverage of the topic is beyond the scope of a "Fundamentals"
course. The Chef wiki has an
[entire page documenting the API](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Exception+and+Report+Handlers).

We'll take a brief look at the requirements to set up a handler.

# Handler Configuration

Chef has two configuration options for setting up a new
report/exception handler.

* `report_handlers`
* `exception_handlers`

These are both Arrays, to which new instantiation of the handler
classes are added.

# Simple Example Handler

We're going to set up a very simple example that prints the name of
the resources updated in the Chef run.

The handler itself doesn't actually do anything, but it could.

Handlers are written in Ruby and loaded by the `chef-client` when it runs.

# Handler Example Code

We'll put this in `/var/chef/handlers/simple_report_handler.rb`, but
it can go anywhere.

    @@@ruby
    require 'chef/handler'
    module SimpleReport
      class UpdatedResources < Chef::Handler
        def report
          Chef::Log.info "Resources updated this run:"
          run_status.updated_resources.each {|r| Chef::Log.info "  #{r.to_s}"}
        end
      end
    end

The handler should inherit `Chef::Handler`. It should define a 'report' method.

Documentation is on the [Chef wiki](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Exception+and+Report+Handlers).

.notes This specific handler can be installed with the ruby gem
"chef-handler-updated-resources".

# Handler Configuration

    @@@ruby
    # /etc/chef/client.rb...
    #
    # a file dropped off by cookbook_file:
    require '/var/chef/handlers/simple_report_handler'

    report_handlers << SimpleReport::UpdatedResources.new
    exception_handlers << SimpleReport::UpdatedResources.new

.notes The 'require' statement does not use the .rb extension of the
file.

# Chef Handler Cookbook

Opscode released a cookbook to make managing report handlers easier.

* [http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef_handler](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef_handler)

Download it to your Chef Repository like any other cookbook:

    knife cookbook site download chef_handler
    tar -zxvf chef_handler-1.0.0.tar.gz -C cookbooks

See the cookbook's README for documentation.

.notes Opscode is working on API endpoints to send reports/exceptions,
but this is not built into the Chef Client or the Chef Handler
cookbook at this time.
